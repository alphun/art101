	<h1>Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
	<p>The point of the lab is to create a file structure locally in my computer, and edit my homepage index.html.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>Some of the challenges that I came across were figuring out how many labs to put in the homepage, since there were 17-18 total labs but we had only done 3. So I opted to put in 6 only. I also struggled in trying to remember the correct syntax to write in some occassions.</p>
	<h3>Result</h3>
	<p>This is the Lab 3 Browser file. And the following screenshots are the progress made.</p>
